        <h2>What is Lorem ipsum?</h2>
        <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <strong>Lorem
                Ipsum</strong> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
            took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
            centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
            popularised in the 1960s with the release of <i>Letraset</i> sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
            more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
